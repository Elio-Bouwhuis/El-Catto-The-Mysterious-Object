Toki: MAXI! MAXI! You have to help us. A strange object fell onto the farm and after one of the cows ate it they started acting strange.
Toki: Their body and eyes changed color and they got angry at anything they saw. I managed to escape, but I'm worried about my friends.
Toki: I saw Flappy run towards the house up north. Please check in on her, she might also have more information on the cows.
Toki: Right, before I forget, You can use WASD to move and LMB to throw your toy at the cows in order to stop them.
Toki: Now, go to my friend Flappy over by the house up north.
